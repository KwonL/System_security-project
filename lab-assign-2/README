Using heap overflow, we can modify second chunk(allocated memory after fisrt melloc).
Modify second chunk as freed and small, then free() will coalesce first chunk with second one.
Using double free bug at this time, we can overwrite "jacket!" 's address at "write_here", and get flag

execution :
    ./exploit.py | ./target
